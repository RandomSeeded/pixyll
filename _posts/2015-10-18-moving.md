Heyo, quick announcement that this site will be moving hosting from the [Nearly Free Speech Network](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) to a custom solution hosted at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). What follows is an imaginary Q&A.

###Q: Why?

Because there's an increasing amount of content that I would like to share on this blog that doesn't meet the constraints of the Nearly Free Speech Network. Games, tools, demonstrations of technologies, and more. This is why the planned part-2 to my [article on sockets](/2015/09/25/sockets/) still has not arrived. I could continually link to a separate site which hosted all these projects, but I'd rather not. Simply put, the NFSN is for static content, and this is no longer going to be a fully static site.

###Q: What does this mean for me?

A continuing temporary slow-down in content while I make the move. Following the move, cool things which wouldn't currently be possible.

###Q: What does this mean for you?

Work.

Update: migration is now complete
