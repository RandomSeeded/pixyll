Hello!

Today I'm proud to introduce [Locket Chat](http://www.locketchat.com), a combination encrypted chat service and all-in-one messenging client.

##The service

Locket chat offers its own messenging service designed with privacy in mind. All messages are encrypted client-side using PGP encryption. The server doesn't save these messages in any form, nor is it capable of decrypting these messages even if they were saved. The same is true for any files sent over the service. Don't believe us? See it for yourself on [Github](https://github.com/interpolating-platypus/Locket), or [view the annotated source](https://quiet-shelf-3419.herokuapp.com/chat.html). Not sure that our server is running the code specified? Run your own! 

##The extension

The extension is where shit gets cool though. Yeah Locket Chat is a super-amazing encrypted chat application with message revocation, no message persistence, no server-side storing of messages, and all design choices made with privacy in mind. That's awesome! But none of your friends are using it yet, and that's a bummer. (You should probably get some cooler friends) Guess what? Download the [Locket Chat Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/locket/kmclnkpagjmledigbephoecmpihidbla) and you can chat with your friends that use Facebook Messenger or Google Hangouts. What's more, if they get the extension too, you can actually have encrypted chat sessions over the existing services.
