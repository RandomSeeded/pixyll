Today's project: [Knockout](/projects/warlocks/) (alt name: Warlocks, after the WC3 mod it was inspired by). 

##The Game:

Left click to move.  Right click to shoot fireballs.

Knock any opposing players off the stage to win.

[Contact me with bugs](/blog/contact) (24-hour project...they're there).

##The Rationale:

Knockouts is a fun little weekend project to explore the server-as-source-of-truth game architecture. The idea being if that we can't trust the players to be honest about their positioning (or anything else really), that means that therefore all 'physics' rendering for the game must be handled server-side. The game client then needs to mirror the source of truth as reported by the server.

What happens when there gets to be some lag? If we implement client-side prediction in order to try to reduce the visual impact of waiting for server truth, what happens if something happens the client didn't expect?
