Mini post!

[It's a thing](https://github.com/RandomSeeded/surf_alert).

It looks mega ugly! It doesn't do a ton! But I've learned a ton of Erlang in the making, and in the future I might make it not terrible.

In the meantime, if you surf OB SF, and you'd like to get an early heads up when some swell's coming in, feel free to [check it out](/projects/surf_alert/).

As always, thoughts / comments / concerns?
