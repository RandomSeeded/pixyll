Check out this weirdness that's part of handling d3 dragging/event handling:

    var drag = d3.behavior.drag()
    .on("drag", function(d,i) {
        d.x += d3.event.dx
        d.y += d3.event.dy
        d3.select(this).attr("transform", function(d,i){
            return "translate(" + [ d.x,d.y ] + ")"
        })
    
    });
        
    var face = d3.select("#charts")
      .append("svg:g")
      .data([ {"x":x, "y":y} ])
      .call(drag);

That last line doesn't seem to make much sense, does it? What exactly are we invoking when we say `.call(drag)`? By standard javascript syntax, it seems like `.select()` or `.append()` is returning a function, which we're then invoking, with our drag variable as the context. Huh???

As it turns out, d3 overwrites the call function with their own:

    d3_selectionPrototype.call = function(callback) {
      var args = d3_array(arguments);
      callback.apply(args[0] = this, args);
      return this;
    };

So when we invoke `selection.call(drag)`, it's actually invoking the above function, not the JS default, and passing `drag` as a callack function, not as the context. Our custom function (`drag`) is then run on the selection, with an event handler for the event `drag`. Confusing, but cool.
